\section{Introduction}

% Here, write a brief introduction to the problem you are solving. This can be adapted from your problem description and motivation from the original proposal. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.

Vehicles with ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems) capabilities need to able to know the distance to objects around them in order to navigate safely. While LIDAR
sensors are often viewed as the gold standard for distance estimation, they are expensive and not always feasible for consumer vehicles.
Another option is Radar, which is cheaper but has lower resolution and must contend with reflections and interference.
Cameras are a cheaper alternative, but estimating depth from monocular images is a challenging problem. In this project, we aim to estimate
the distance to objects using only monocular images and bounding boxes generated by the YOLO object detection algorithm.

As a end goal, we hope to create a model that can accurately estimate the distance to objects so it can be usded in sensor fusion algorithms for
autonomous vehicles. A combination of Radar and camera-based distance estimates is one way to help achieve a balance of cost and accuracy
that is needed for consumer vehicles.


\section{Related Work}

% Here, talk about the related work you encountered for your approach. Cite at least 5 references. Refer to item 2. No one has done exactly your task? Write about the most similar thing you can find. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.

We surveyed a number of related works in the area of monocular distance estimation. Many works focus on
end-to-end deep learning approaches that take in raw images and full output depth maps.
For example, \cite{godard2017} proposed an unsupervised learning approach for depth estimation using
rectified monocular images. However, these methods are theoretically and computationally
more complex than object based distance estimation. While depth maps are required for a camera only system, 
we theorize it is possible to achieve good distance estimation performance using only object bounding boxes.
This would allow for a simpler and more efficient model that could be more easily integrated into existing
autonomous vehicle systems.

Examples that we found that that took simpler approaches to this issue include Disnet which uses 
a YOLO pre-pipline to handle object detection, passing the object data from YOLO to a Multi Hidden-Layer Neural
Network to estimate the distance of this object. Disnet was trained using supervised techniques on 3d laser scanner (LIDAR)
measurements as ground truth.\cite{Haseeb2018DisNetAN}. Others such as\cite{Franke2021} have build off Disnet,
expanding it with optimized YOLO models.

More recently some such as \cite{Felipe2025} have created a new approach as a combination of depth-map and
object based distance esimation: Object Distance Estimation Network (ODENet). This approach combines a depth map generated
using MiDaS\cite{Ranftl2022} and object image detection from YOLOv8\cite{yolov8_ultralytics} with a multilayer
perceptron.


\section{Dataset}

You should write about your dataset here, following the guidelines regarding item 1. This section may be 0.5-1 pages. Depending on your specific dataset, you may want to include subsections for the preprocessing, annotation, etc.

\section{Features}

Describe any features you used for your model, or how your data was input to your model. Are you doing feature engineering or feature selection? Are you learning embeddings? Is it all part of one neural network? Refer to item 2. This may range from 0.25 pages to 0.5 pages.
- Onehot vector for object classes

\section{Implementation}

% Describe your model and implementation here. Refer to item 4. This may take around a page.
Our current implementation is a simplfied object based distance estimator. It uses YOLOv8\cite{yolov8_ultralytics}
to generate bounding box coordinates and object classification, then passing this data to our model. We found that
for this set of input features a 8 layer neural netowork with 128 neurons per layer and ELU activation worked best.
Estimations aren't perfect but are often within $\pm10\%$ of the real distance. 

\section{Results and Evaluation}

How are you evaluating your model? What results do you have so far? What are your baselines? Refer to item 5. This may take around 0.5 pages.

\section{Feedback and Plans}

Write about your plans for the remainder of the project. This should include a discussion of the feedback you received from your TA, and how you plan to improve your approach. Reflect on your implementation and areas for improvement. Refer to item 6. This may be around 0.5 pages.

Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).
